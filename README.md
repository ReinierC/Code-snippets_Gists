# My Gists / Code Snippets
Since I found no clear route to my Gists from within my Github account, here's the url:

## [My Gists](https://gist.github.com/ReinierC)

Maybe I'm wrong going through the effort of creating ***_Gists_*** for [my code snippets](https://gist.github.com/ReinierC) instead of adding repositories for them?

Let me know if you have an opinion about this,  
I'm curious about opinions concerning this question.
